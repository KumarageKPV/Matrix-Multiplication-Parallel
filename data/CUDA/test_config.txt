# Block Size Analysis Configuration

# This file documents the test configuration for block size sweep
# Modify these parameters to customize performance analysis

# Matrix size for block size sweep
SWEEP_N=1024

# Block sizes to test
BLOCK_SIZES=8,16,24,32,48,64

# Expected output columns in block_size_analysis.csv:
# N, block_size, time_sec, checksum, GFLOPs

# Performance metrics:
# - time_sec: Kernel execution time (CUDA events)
# - GFLOPs: (2*N^3)/(time*10^9) floating-point operations per second
# - checksum: Validation against expected_checksums.txt

# Optimal block size typically:
# - 32x32 for most modern GPUs (RTX 20xx, 30xx, 40xx, A100)
# - 16x16 for older architectures or memory-constrained GPUs
# - 64x64 may exceed shared memory limits on some GPUs
