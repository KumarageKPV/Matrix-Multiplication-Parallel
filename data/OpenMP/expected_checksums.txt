# Expected Checksums for Verification
# Using deterministic LCG initializer with seeds: A=1, B=2
# Checksums are platform-independent and must match exactly

# Format: N, Checksum
# All block sizes should produce identical checksums for given N

# Verification Notes:
# - Checksums are computed as sum of all elements in result matrix C
# - Must match serial baseline exactly (floating-point addition is commutative)
# - Same checksum across all thread counts confirms correctness
# - Same checksum across all block sizes confirms tiling logic
# - Deviation > 1e-6 indicates implementation error

# Cross-Implementation Validation:
# Serial, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA should all produce identical checksums
# for the same N (with same initializer seeds)
